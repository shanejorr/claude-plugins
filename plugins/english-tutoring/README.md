# english-tutoring

Personal Cowork plugin for Shane's at-home English tutoring of Camilo (13) and Luciana (16). Encodes the lesson-creation and progress-tracking workflows used in the project at `/Users/shaneorr/Documents/English`. Both children are CEFR A1 entering Cobb County public schools in August 2026.

This plugin is project-specific by design — paths, Drive folder IDs, student profiles, and pedagogical conventions live in the project's `CLAUDE.md` and the bundled skills. It is not intended for general distribution.

## Skills

### create-lesson

Generates a full numbered lesson: the teacher lesson plan PDF, a shared grammar/topic notes sheet, and per-kid practice materials for both children. Reads the project's coverage tracker, vocabulary log, and lesson schedule first so it doesn't re-teach material or recycle character names. Pitches everything to CEFR A1 by default. Optionally uploads the rendered PDFs to two separate Google Drive folders via the bundled `upload_to_drive.py` script.

Trigger phrases: "create lesson N", "build lesson N", "make lesson N", "generate lesson N", "prep lesson N".

### confirm-lesson

Updates `Progress/coverage_tracker.md` and `Progress/vocabulary_log.md` after a lesson has actually been taught. Pulls the grammar point and glossed vocabulary out of the lesson PDFs, asks for the date taught and the interest-rotation tag, then edits both files in place. Does not capture subjective lesson-outcome notes (per-kid status, observations, pacing changes, review-queue items). Per project rules these files are never updated until Shane confirms the lesson happened.

Trigger phrases: "confirm lesson N", "we taught lesson N", "mark lesson N as taught", "update tracker for lesson N", "log lesson N".

## Bundled scripts

`skills/create-lesson/scripts/upload_to_drive.py` uploads lesson PDFs to Google Drive using a service-account credential at `~/.config/create-lesson/service_account.json`. The full one-time setup (creating the service account, sharing the Drive folders with it) is documented in the script's docstring. Dependencies: `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`.

## Project assumptions

The skills assume the project layout described in `/Users/shaneorr/Documents/English/CLAUDE.md`:

- `Progress/coverage_tracker.md`, `Progress/vocabulary_log.md`, `Progress/Lesson_Schedule.md`
- `Teacher Materials/Lesson_NN_teacher.pdf` (flat)
- `Student Materials/Lesson_NN/` containing `Notes_<TOPIC>_SHARED.pdf`, `Materials_Camilo.pdf`, `Materials_Luciana.pdf`

If the project layout changes, both SKILL.md files need to be updated to match.
